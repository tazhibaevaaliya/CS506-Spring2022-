Deep learning is an artificial intelligence technology that enables computer vision, speech recognition in mobile phones, machine translation, AI games, driverless cars, and other applications. When we use consumer products from Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, or Baidu, we are often interacting with a deep learning system. In this volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, computer scientist John Kelleher offers an accessible and concise but comprehensive introduction to the fundamental technology at the heart of the artificial intelligence revolution. Kelleher explains that deep learning enables data-driven decisions by identifying and extracting patterns from large datasets; its ability to learn from complex data makes deep learning ideally suited to take advantage of the rapid growth in big data and computational power. Kelleher also explains some of the basic concepts in deep learning, presents a history of advances in the field, and discusses the current state of the art. He describes the most important deep learning architectures, including autoencoders, recurrent neural networks, and long short-term networks, as well as such recent developments as Generative Adversarial Networks and capsule networks. He also provides a comprehensive (and comprehensible) introduction to the two fundamental algorithms in deep learning: gradient descent and backpropagation. Finally, Kelleher considers the future of deep learning—major trends, possible developments, and significant challenges.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780262537551'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0262537559'}]",False,True,296.0,BOOK,['Computers'],,,NOT_MATURE,False,1.3.0.0.preview.1,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=b06qDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=b06qDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=b06qDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Deep+Learning&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=b06qDwAAQBAJ&dq=Deep+Learning&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Deep_Learning.html?hl=&id=b06qDwAAQBAJ,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,False,,False,,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=b06qDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"In this volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, computer scientist John Kelleher offers an accessible and concise but comprehensive introduction to the fundamental technology at the heart of the artificial intelligence ...",

This concise, project-driven guide to deep learning takes readers through a series of program-writing tasks that introduce them to the use of deep learning in such areas of artificial intelligence as computer vision, natural-language processing, and reinforcement learning. The author, a longtime artificial intelligence researcher specializing in natural-language processing, covers feed-forward neural nets, convolutional neural nets, word embeddings, recurrent neural nets, sequence-to-sequence learning, deep reinforcement learning, unsupervised models, and other fundamental concepts and techniques. Students and practitioners learn the basics of deep learning by working through programs in Tensorflow, an open-source machine learning framework. “I find I learn computer science material best by sitting down and writing programs,” the author writes, and the book reflects this approach. Each chapter includes a programming project, exercises, and references for further reading. An early chapter is devoted to Tensorflow and its interface with Python, the widely used programming language. Familiarity with linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and probability and statistics is required, as is a rudimentary knowledge of programming in Python.

Aggarwal'],Springer,2018-08-25,"This book covers both classical and modern models in deep learning. The primary focus is on the theory and algorithms of deep learning. The theory and algorithms of neural networks are particularly important for understanding important concepts, so that one can understand the important design concepts of neural architectures in different applications. Why do neural networks work? When do they work better than off-the-shelf machine-learning models? When is depth useful? Why is training neural networks so hard? What are the pitfalls? The book is also rich in discussing different applications in order to give the practitioner a flavor of how neural architectures are designed for different types of problems. Applications associated with many different areas like recommender systems, machine translation, image captioning, image classification, reinforcement-learning based gaming, and text analytics are covered. The chapters of this book span three categories: The basics of neural networks: Many traditional machine learning models can be understood as special cases of neural networks. An emphasis is placed in the first two chapters on understanding the relationship between traditional machine learning and neural networks. Support vector machines, linear/logistic regression, singular value decomposition, matrix factorization, and recommender systems are shown to be special cases of neural networks. These methods are studied together with recent feature engineering methods like word2vec. Fundamentals of neural networks: A detailed discussion of training and regularization is provided in Chapters 3 and 4. Chapters 5 and 6 present radial-basis function (RBF) networks and restricted Boltzmann machines. Advanced topics in neural networks: Chapters 7 and 8 discuss recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks. Several advanced topics like deep reinforcement learning, neural Turing machines, Kohonen self-organizing maps, and generative adversarial networks are introduced in Chapters 9 and 10. The book is written for graduate students, researchers, and practitioners. Numerous exercises are available along with a solution manual to aid in classroom teaching. Where possible, an application-centric view is highlighted in order to provide an understanding of the practical uses of each class of techniques.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9783319944630'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '3319944630'}]",True,True,497.0,BOOK,['Computers'],1.0,1.0,NOT_MATURE,True,1.1.2.0.preview.3,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=achqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=achqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=achqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Deep+Learning&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=achqDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=achqDwAAQBAJ,US,FOR_SALE_AND_RENTAL,True,79.99,USD,63.99,USD,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=achqDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-achqDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'finskyOfferType': 1, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 79990000, 'currencyCode': 'USD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 63990000, 'currencyCode': 'USD'}, 'giftable': True}, {'finskyOfferType': 3, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 28000000, 'currencyCode': 'USD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 24360000, 'currencyCode': 'USD'}, 'rentalDuration': {'unit': 'DAY', 'count': 90}}]",US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,True,http://books.google.com/books/download/Neural_Networks_and_Deep_Learning-sample-epub.acsm?id=achqDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,True,http://books.google.com/books/download/Neural_Networks_and_Deep_Learning-sample-pdf.acsm?id=achqDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=achqDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,This book covers both classical and modern models in deep learning.,A Textbook
