Despite this growth, there are few resources addressed to students and scholars who wish to take advantage of these powerful tools. Humanities Data Analysis offers the first intermediate-level guide to quantitative data analysis for humanities students and scholars using the Python programming language. This practical textbook, which assumes a basic knowledge of Python, teaches readers the necessary skills for conducting humanities research in the rapidly developing digital environment. The book begins with an overview of the place of data science in the humanities, and proceeds to cover data carpentry: the essential techniques for gathering, cleaning, representing, and transforming textual and tabular data. Then, drawing from real-world, publicly available data sets that cover a variety of scholarly domains, the book delves into detailed case studies. Focusing on textual data analysis, the authors explore such diverse topics as network analysis, genre theory, onomastics, literacy, author attribution, mapping, stylometry, topic modeling, and time series analysis. Exercises and resources for further reading are provided at the end of each chapter. An ideal resource for humanities students and scholars aiming to take their Python skills to the next level, Humanities Data Analysis illustrates the benefits that quantitative methods can bring to complex research questions.

Huber'],John Wiley & Sons,2012-01-09,"This book explores the many provocative questions concerning the fundamentals of data analysis. It is based on the time-tested experience of one of the gurus of the subject matter. Why should one study data analysis? How should it be taught? What techniques work best, and for whom? How valid are the results? How much data should be tested? Which machine languages should be used, if used at all? Emphasis on apprenticeship (through hands-on case studies) and anecdotes (through real-life applications) are the tools that Peter J. Huber uses in this volume. Concern with specific statistical techniques is not of immediate value; rather, questions of strategy – when to use which technique – are employed. Central to the discussion is an understanding of the significance of massive (or robust) data sets, the implementation of languages, and the use of models. Each is sprinkled with an ample number of examples and case studies. Personal practices, various pitfalls, and existing controversies are presented when applicable. The book serves as an excellent philosophical and historical companion to any present-day text in data analysis, robust statistics, data mining, statistical learning, or computational statistics.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781118018262'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1118018265'}]",True,True,234,BOOK,['Mathematics'],,,NOT_MATURE,False,0.5.6.0.preview.3,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6OSvDBE0rCIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6OSvDBE0rCIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=6OSvDBE0rCIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Data+Analysis&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6OSvDBE0rCIC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6OSvDBE0rCIC,US,FOR_SALE,True,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,True,True,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=6OSvDBE0rCIC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,This book explores the many provocative questions concerning the fundamentals of data analysis.

This book offers state-of-the-art solutions to this age-old problem by presenting methodological and data-analytic approaches useful in investigating processes that take place among dyads: couples, coworkers, parent and child, teacher and student, or doctor and patient, to name just a few. Rich examples from psychology and across the behavioral and social sciences help build the researcher's ability to conceptualize relationship processes; model and test for actor effects, partner effects, and relationship effects; and model and control for the statistical interdependence that can exist between partners. The companion website provides clarifications, elaborations, corrections, and data and files for each chapter.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781462546138'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1462546137'}]",False,False,458,BOOK,['Psychology'],,,NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tO4CEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tO4CEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=tO4CEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Data+Analysis&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=tO4CEAAAQBAJ&dq=Data+Analysis&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Dyadic_Data_Analysis.html?hl=&id=tO4CEAAAQBAJ,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,False,False,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=tO4CEAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"This book offers state-of-the-art solutions to this age-old problem by presenting methodological and data-analytic approaches useful in investigating processes that take place among dyads: couples, coworkers, parent and child, teacher and ...",False,False,,,,,,,,
