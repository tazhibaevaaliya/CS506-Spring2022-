Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

Many successful applications of machine learning exist already, including systems that analyze past sales data to predict customer behavior, optimize robot behavior so that a task can be completed using minimum resources, and extract knowledge from bioinformatics data. Introduction to Machine Learning is a comprehensive textbook on the subject, covering a broad array of topics not usually included in introductory machine learning texts. Subjects include supervised learning; Bayesian decision theory; parametric, semi-parametric, and nonparametric methods; multivariate analysis; hidden Markov models; reinforcement learning; kernel machines; graphical models; Bayesian estimation; and statistical testing.Machine learning is rapidly becoming a skill that computer science students must master before graduation. The third edition of Introduction to Machine Learning reflects this shift, with added support for beginners, including selected solutions for exercises and additional example data sets (with code available online). Other substantial changes include discussions of outlier detection; ranking algorithms for perceptrons and support vector machines; matrix decomposition and spectral methods; distance estimation; new kernel algorithms; deep learning in multilayered perceptrons; and the nonparametric approach to Bayesian methods. All learning algorithms are explained so that students can easily move from the equations in the book to a computer program. The book can be used by both advanced undergraduates and graduate students. It will also be of interest to professionals who are concerned with the application of machine learning methods.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780262028189'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0262028182'}]",False,True,640.0,BOOK,['Computers'],3.0,2.0,NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NP5bBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NP5bBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=NP5bBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Machine+Learning&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=NP5bBAAAQBAJ&dq=Machine+Learning&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Machine_Learning.html?hl=&id=NP5bBAAAQBAJ,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,False,,False,,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=NP5bBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,Introduction -- Supervised learning -- Bayesian decision theory -- Parametric methods -- Multivariate methods -- Dimensionality reduction -- Clustering -- Nonparametric methods -- Decision trees -- Linear discrimination -- Multilayer ...,

The book presents the major machine learning methods as they have been developed in different disciplines, such as statistics, statistical and adaptive signal processing and computer science. Focusing on the physical reasoning behind the mathematics, all the various methods and techniques are explained in depth, supported by examples and problems, giving an invaluable resource to the student and researcher for understanding and applying machine learning concepts. The book builds carefully from the basic classical methods to the most recent trends, with chapters written to be as self-contained as possible, making the text suitable for different courses: pattern recognition, statistical/adaptive signal processing, statistical/Bayesian learning, as well as short courses on sparse modeling, deep learning, and probabilistic graphical models. All major classical techniques: Mean/Least-Squares regression and filtering, Kalman filtering, stochastic approximation and online learning, Bayesian classification, decision trees, logistic regression and boosting methods. The latest trends: Sparsity, convex analysis and optimization, online distributed algorithms, learning in RKH spaces, Bayesian inference, graphical and hidden Markov models, particle filtering, deep learning, dictionary learning and latent variables modeling. Case studies - protein folding prediction, optical character recognition, text authorship identification, fMRI data analysis, change point detection, hyperspectral image unmixing, target localization, channel equalization and echo cancellation, show how the theory can be applied. MATLAB code for all the main algorithms are available on an accompanying website, enabling the reader to experiment with the code.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780128017227'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0128017228'}]",True,True,1062.0,BOOK,['Computers'],5.0,1.0,NOT_MATURE,True,1.3.3.0.preview.3,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NHODBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NHODBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=NHODBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Machine+Learning&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NHODBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NHODBAAAQBAJ,US,FOR_SALE,True,99.95,USD,79.96,USD,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NHODBAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-NHODBAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'finskyOfferType': 1, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 99950000, 'currencyCode': 'USD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 79960000, 'currencyCode': 'USD'}, 'giftable': True}]",US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,True,http://books.google.com/books/download/Machine_Learning-sample-epub.acsm?id=NHODBAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,True,http://books.google.com/books/download/Machine_Learning-sample-pdf.acsm?id=NHODBAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=NHODBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"This tutorial text gives a unifying perspective on machine learning by covering both probabilistic and deterministic approaches -which are based on optimization techniques – together with the Bayesian inference approach, whose essence ...",A Bayesian and Optimization Perspective
