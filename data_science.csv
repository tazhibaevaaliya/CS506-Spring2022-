Kelleher', 'Brendan Tierney']",MIT Press,2018-04-13,"A concise introduction to the emerging field of data science, explaining its evolution, relation to machine learning, current uses, data infrastructure issues, and ethical challenges. The goal of data science is to improve decision making through the analysis of data. Today data science determines the ads we see online, the books and movies that are recommended to us online, which emails are filtered into our spam folders, and even how much we pay for health insurance. This volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series offers a concise introduction to the emerging field of data science, explaining its evolution, current uses, data infrastructure issues, and ethical challenges. It has never been easier for organizations to gather, store, and process data. Use of data science is driven by the rise of big data and social media, the development of high-performance computing, and the emergence of such powerful methods for data analysis and modeling as deep learning. Data science encompasses a set of principles, problem definitions, algorithms, and processes for extracting non-obvious and useful patterns from large datasets. It is closely related to the fields of data mining and machine learning, but broader in scope. This book offers a brief history of the field, introduces fundamental data concepts, and describes the stages in a data science project. It considers data infrastructure and the challenges posed by integrating data from multiple sources, introduces the basics of machine learning, and discusses how to link machine learning expertise with real-world problems. The book also reviews ethical and legal issues, developments in data regulation, and computational approaches to preserving privacy. Finally, it considers the future impact of data science and offers principles for success in data science projects.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780262535434'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0262535432'}]",False,True,280,BOOK,['Computers'],3.0,1.0,NOT_MATURE,False,1.1.1.0.preview.1,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TFpVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TFpVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=TFpVDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Data+Science&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=TFpVDwAAQBAJ&dq=Data+Science&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Data_Science.html?hl=&id=TFpVDwAAQBAJ,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,False,False,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=TFpVDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"This volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series offers a concise introduction to the emerging field of data science, explaining its evolution, current uses, data infrastructure issues, and ethical challenges.",,,,,,,,

Irizarry'],CRC Press,2019-11-20,"Introduction to Data Science: Data Analysis and Prediction Algorithms with R introduces concepts and skills that can help you tackle real-world data analysis challenges. It covers concepts from probability, statistical inference, linear regression, and machine learning. It also helps you develop skills such as R programming, data wrangling, data visualization, predictive algorithm building, file organization with UNIX/Linux shell, version control with Git and GitHub, and reproducible document preparation. This book is a textbook for a first course in data science. No previous knowledge of R is necessary, although some experience with programming may be helpful. The book is divided into six parts: R, data visualization, statistics with R, data wrangling, machine learning, and productivity tools. Each part has several chapters meant to be presented as one lecture. The author uses motivating case studies that realistically mimic a data scientist’s experience. He starts by asking specific questions and answers these through data analysis so concepts are learned as a means to answering the questions. Examples of the case studies included are: US murder rates by state, self-reported student heights, trends in world health and economics, the impact of vaccines on infectious disease rates, the financial crisis of 2007-2008, election forecasting, building a baseball team, image processing of hand-written digits, and movie recommendation systems. The statistical concepts used to answer the case study questions are only briefly introduced, so complementing with a probability and statistics textbook is highly recommended for in-depth understanding of these concepts. If you read and understand the chapters and complete the exercises, you will be prepared to learn the more advanced concepts and skills needed to become an expert.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781000708035'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1000708039'}]",True,True,713,BOOK,['Mathematics'],,,NOT_MATURE,False,1.2.2.0.preview.3,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Data+Science&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&dq=Data+Science&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Data_Science.html?hl=&id=xb29DwAAQBAJ,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,True,True,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"This book is a textbook for a first course in data science.

Bruce', 'Grant Fleming']",John Wiley & Sons,2021-04-13,"Explore the most serious prevalent ethical issues in data science with this insightful new resource The increasing popularity of data science has resulted in numerous well-publicized cases of bias, injustice, and discrimination. The widespread deployment of “Black box” algorithms that are difficult or impossible to understand and explain, even for their developers, is a primary source of these unanticipated harms, making modern techniques and methods for manipulating large data sets seem sinister, even dangerous. When put in the hands of authoritarian governments, these algorithms have enabled suppression of political dissent and persecution of minorities. To prevent these harms, data scientists everywhere must come to understand how the algorithms that they build and deploy may harm certain groups or be unfair. Responsible Data Science delivers a comprehensive, practical treatment of how to implement data science solutions in an even-handed and ethical manner that minimizes the risk of undue harm to vulnerable members of society. Both data science practitioners and managers of analytics teams will learn how to: Improve model transparency, even for black box models Diagnose bias and unfairness within models using multiple metrics Audit projects to ensure fairness and minimize the possibility of unintended harm Perfect for data science practitioners, Responsible Data Science will also earn a spot on the bookshelves of technically inclined managers, software developers, and statisticians.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781119741770'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1119741777'}]",False,True,304,BOOK,['Computers'],,,NOT_MATURE,False,1.1.2.0.preview.1,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XiUqEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XiUqEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=XiUqEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Data+Science&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XiUqEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XiUqEAAAQBAJ,US,FOR_SALE,True,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,False,True,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=XiUqEAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"In this book you’ll learn how to improve the interpretability of AI models, and audit them to reduce bias and unfairness, thereby inspiring greater confidence in the minds of customers, employees, regulators, legislators and other ...",,http://books.google.com/books/download/Responsible_Data_Science-sample-pdf.acsm?id=XiUqEAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,24.0,USD,24.0,USD,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XiUqEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-XiUqEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'finskyOfferType': 1, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 24000000, 'currencyCode': 'USD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 24000000, 'currencyCode': 'USD'}, 'giftable': True}]"
